          <p>Hi! My name is Harmony Houg. I am based in Kansas City and Maryville, Missouri. I use a Nikon D3000 for my camera.
            I have been a photographer since 2018 and a designer since 2023. I am excited to broaden my skillset with any job I am in.
          </p>
          
          <p>Mission Statement:
             The purpose of this website is to have a place online where people can see my past work and decide if they want me to take them in as a client for photography or design.
          </p>
