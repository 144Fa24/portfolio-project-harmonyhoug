                <h4>How did I get into Photography?</h4>
                <p>For my whole life, I wanted to be a musician but, that changed Junior year of high school when we got a new band director.
                   Band wasn't fun anymore and I wanted to try something different. I always liked taking photographs of my friends, and we always did random photoshoots.
                   I took a photography class the next semester and fell in love with it. My parents bought me a camera and accessories and now it is my major and I have my own business.
                   It's called Harmony Studios for anyone wondering.</p>
